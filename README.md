- Created by: Jethro Immanuel Peralta, Zachary van Vorst, Raymond Kang
- This visualization uses a choropleth to track the best regions and players for the videogame Super Smash Bros. Melee

## Control
- You can zoom in and out of the choropleth to get a better view of small countries or player portraits
- To move forward or back a year, use the arrows above the year on the left. The starting year is 2001

## Map Coloring
- Higher skilled regions are a darker blue, while lower ranked regions are a lighter one till it reaches gray
- Coloring is relative to the highest ranked region of the given year

## Highlighting
- Hovering over an element of Key Moments will highlight the associated region with that event
- Hovering over a player listing in the SSBMRank or RetroSSBMRank will highlight the region that player is from

## Filtering
- You can click on a region to filter/focus on that region
- The region will turn brown when selected
- To deselect a region, click on it again or click a different region
- When filtering on a region, a line graph showing the region's skill history will appear, with the point associated with the current year being highlighted

## Player Portraits
- Player portraits serve as our advanced mark for the choropleth
- Player portraits have a line connecting the player to the region they're from
- Larger player portraits have a high rank, small player portraits have a low rank
- Scaling is relative to the highest and lowest ranked player
